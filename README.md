# Welcome to the Developer Portal with GCP Integrations!

This is a Developer Portal, which allows developers to run administrative tasks without
giving complete access and abilities to all those with access to the repo.

Example: Release Engineer -- 

This portal will allow users to release products to GCP, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run Applications, etc.

```bash
reflex run
```

## Developer Information

### Adding Pages

In this template, the pages in your app are defined in `{your_app}/pages/`.
Each page is a function that returns a Reflex component.
For example, to edit this page you can modify `{your_app}/pages/index.py`.
See the [pages docs](https://reflex.dev/docs/pages/routes/) for more information on pages.

In this template, instead of using `rx.add_page` or the `@rx.page` decorator,
we use the `@template` decorator from `{your_app}/templates/template.py`.

To add a new page:

1. Add a new file in `{your_app}/pages/`. We recommend using one file per page, but you can also group pages in a single file.
2. Add a new function with the `@template` decorator, which takes the same arguments as `@rx.page`.
3. Import the page in your `{your_app}/pages/__init__.py` file and it will automatically be added to the app.

### Adding Components

In order to keep your code organized, we recommend putting components that are
used across multiple pages in the `{your_app}/components/` directory.

In this template, we have a sidebar component in `{your_app}/components/sidebar.py`.

### Adding State

As your app grows, we recommend using [substates](https://reflex.dev/docs/substates/overview/)
to organize your state.

You can either define substates in their own files, or if the state is
specific to a page, you can define it in the page file itself.
